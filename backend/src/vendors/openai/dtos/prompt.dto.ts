  Make sure the mad lib is at least 3 sentences and at least 500 characters. Use brackets [] whenever an input is required and include the type of speach inside it. Make sure that there isn't any spaces in between the brackets, and instead of using spaces, use _ for the space inside the brackets []. 
  There needs to be at least 4 mad lib inputs. This is very important. Spread them out throughout the madlib. Make sure the inputs are formatted properly. Use snake case if the type of speech has a space. The response must be in json format. Include in the json response a property of categories that is an array of strings of what the category it is. Futhermore, include a property isPg that is a boolean value if the madlib is PG rated. The madlib should be a property of madlib and is of type string. Also include a property of title that is the title of the madlib.`;
